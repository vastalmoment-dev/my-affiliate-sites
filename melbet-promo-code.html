        <h2>Maximizing the $150 bonus</h2>
        <p>To extract real value from the $150 bonus, the main goal is to confirm the exact distribution and playthrough method. If the $150 is a deposit match, consider the effective amount you must stake to release bonus funds; if it is credited as bet tokens, plan qualifying bets for the markets that count fully.</p>

        <p>Use moderate, eligible stakes that meet any minimum odds; avoid sharp betting that conflicts with the terms. Splitting stakes across eligible markets often reduces variance when meeting wagering requirements and helps preserve capital across the playthrough period.</p>

        <p>Finally, treat the bonus as a limited-time resource — track time windows closely and avoid leaving credits unused until expiry.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>Practical example</h2>
        <p>Scenario: if Melbet credits $150 as a one-time matched deposit with a 6x playthrough, and you deposit $100, the bonus component will be $100 and you would need to turnover $600 on qualifying bets at the required minimum odds. By splitting turnover across multiple low-variance bets rather than one high-risk bet, you reduce the chance of failing the playthrough.</p>

        <p>In staged credit scenarios, schedule bets to trigger each credit release at reasonable stakes and make sure each bet meets the eligibility requirements so credits are not withheld or returned.</p>

        <p>These examples show that preparation and a modest risk approach help you convert a headline $150 into usable funds without unnecessary losses.</p>
