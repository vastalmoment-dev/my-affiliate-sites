    <h1>Trusted promo codes and step-by-step guides for new users</h1>

    <section class="intro">
      <p>BetPromoGuide is a focused resource for new users looking to claim bonus offers at leading bookmakers. We collect current promo codes and explain, in plain language, how to apply them, what the terms mean, and which features to look for when deciding whether to claim. Our pages emphasize transparency, safety and responsible play — not guarantees or misleading promises. 18+ only.</p>

      <p>Promo value depends on how clearly the terms are written and how reasonable wagering requirements are in practice. A bonus with low wagering and broad market eligibility often delivers better practical value than a higher nominal bonus with strict restrictions.</p>

      <p>Below you can compare the current offers, read more about each bookmaker’s onboarding and KYC approach, and jump to full step-by-step guides with clear promo boxes and 'Get Started' CTAs.</p>

      <h2>How to choose an offer</h2>
      <h3>Evaluate wagering requirements</h3>
      <p>Look beyond headline numbers and compare the wagering multiplier, eligible markets and any minimum odds requirements. A lower multiplier and broad market eligibility usually mean you can convert bonus funds to withdrawable funds more easily.</p>

      <h3>Check KYC and withdrawal rules</h3>
      <p><strong>No KYC required for basic registration; identity verification may be required for withdrawals or as required by local law.</strong> Many sites allow account creation and limited play without immediate identity verification. However, identity verification is commonly required before withdrawals or to access higher limits; requirements vary by bookmaker and payment method.</p>

      <h3>How to compare offers</h3>
      <p>When comparing offers, consider the practical steps needed to unlock the value. Read the eligible bet types, minimum odds and any exclusions carefully. A $150 bonus with low wagering and broad eligibility will typically be more useful than a larger headline number that is tightly restricted.</p>

      <p>Also factor in deposit options and timeframes for playthrough; a complex bonus that requires high minimum odds is harder to clear without significant risk. Use the comparison table above to quickly identify the first-deposit value, and click through to the full guide for steps and examples.</p>

      <h2>Reader tips & quick checklist</h2>
      <p>Before claiming a bonus, follow this quick checklist: confirm the exact bonus mechanics, check the minimum deposit, review wagering rules and eligible markets, verify acceptable payment methods, and note the time limits for playthrough. Doing these five checks takes only a few minutes and prevents common issues with locking and withdrawal delays.</p>

      <p>Tip: always use reputable payment methods listed on the official registration page. If a bonus appears not to apply, document the issue with screenshots and contact the bookmaker’s support promptly to resolve it while evidence is fresh.</p>

      <p><strong>Final summary:</strong> The $150 first-deposit bonus is a strong offer when the wagering terms are reasonable. Use the comparison table above, read full promotion terms using the 'Get Started' links, and apply the checklist to decide which offer suits your style and budget.</p>

      <p>Short reminder: check the official promotion pages frequently as offers and terms change. Use deposit limits and account tools to stay within your budget while taking advantage of welcome bonuses.</p>
